# A2SV Contest Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various Codeforces contest problems. As part of the A2SV (Africa to Silicon Valley) program, I use this space to store and organize my competitive programming solutions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Contests/**: Solutions grouped by contest rounds
  - Each contest has its own folder (e.g., `Contest_1234/`)
  - Inside each contest folder, problems are named by their Codeforces problem ID (e.g., `A.cpp`, `B.py`)

- **Problems/**: Solutions organized by problem difficulty or topic (if applicable)

- **Templates/**: Reusable code templates for common competitive programming patterns

## Languages Used
- **Python**

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/J0na555/a2sv-contest.git
   cd a2sv-contest
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired contest or problem folder

3. Compile and run the solutions as needed:
   - For Python: `python solution.py`


## Problem Sources

All problems are from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). Each solution file includes:
- Problem link in comments
- Problem statement summary
- Approach explanation
- Time and space complexity analysis

## Learning Goals

This repository serves as:
- A personal archive of solved problems
- A reference for similar problem patterns
- A showcase of problem-solving approaches
- A learning tool for competitive programming

## Contributing

This is a personal repository for tracking my progress. However, suggestions for improvements or alternative solutions are welcome via issues or pull requests.
