# 🧠 OVERALL RULES (READ THIS FIRST)

Before the list, these rules apply **every single day**:

1. ⏱️ **Time cap**
    
    - A problem: **5–10 min**
        
    - B problem: **15–25 min**
        
    - If stuck → stop → read editorial → understand → re-implement
        
2. ✍️ **Mandatory classification**  
    For every problem, write (mentally or on paper):
    
    > “This is ___ (string / math / greedy / simulation / counting)”
    
3. 🧪 **Manual dry run before coding** (especially B)  
    If you skip this → you’re wasting time.

### ✅ DAY 14 — Cleanup & Confidence

- Re-solve **A + B** problems you missed in contest
    
- End by solving **3 easy problems fast**
    

You should finish feeling **calm**, not stressed.

---

# 🚨 Final Reality Check (Important)

If you **honestly do this for 2 weeks**:

- A problems become automatic
    
- B problems stop being scary
    
- Contests feel structured, not random
    

If you half-ass it:

- Nothing changes
    
- You stay stuck blaming difficulty
    

This plan works **only if executed strictly**.
